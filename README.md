# Greedy-Path-Finder
A topographic map is a two-dimensional representation of a terrain, usually utilizing contour lines to represent changes in elevations. A digital representation of a topographic map samples elevations at regular intervals, essentially representing the continuous terrain as a two-dimensional grid of discrete elevations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a large database of topographic maps, and even [provides a free tool for generating digitized topographic maps](https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/grid-extract/index.html).

Java project that takes these digitized topographical maps stored as .dat files, and uses a greedy algorithm in attempt to find the path with the least change in elevation
